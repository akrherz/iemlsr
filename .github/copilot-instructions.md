# IEM Local Storm Report (LSR) Repo

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the
output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context

This repo is a single page app / dashboard for NWS Local Storm Reports.

## Rules

1. Jquery should not be used.
2. Any instances of Jquery should be replaced with vanilla javascript.
3. Code comments should not be used to explain the commit difference, but to
   explain the codes functionality.
4. After making a change, an audit of the code should be performed to ensure
   that all variables are defined, there are no unused variables, and that
   there are no unused ES Module imports.
5. After making a change, tests should be generated to ensure that all modified
   code is covered by tests.
